    ;Notes:
    ;  For cdecl; EAX, ECX, and EDX are already saved by the caller and don't need to be saved again
    ;  EIP is already saved on the stack by the caller's "CALL" instruction
    ;  The task isn't able to change CR3 so it doesn't need to be saved
    ;  Segment registers are constants (while running kernel code) so they don't need to be saved
